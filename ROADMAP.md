# Roadmap

## Done ✓

- **Foundation** - LM, Prompt, Predictor primitives
- **Vision Support** - Image class for multimodal models

## What's Coming

### History & Tracking
Better tracking for LM and Predictor interactions. Current `LM.history` is basic—need a proper design for monitoring, debugging, and analyzing how your models behave.

### Few-Shot Tuning
DSPy-style optimization for your few-shot examples. Let the system figure out the best examples for you.

### Instruction Tuning
GEPA-inspired instruction optimization. Auto-tune your prompts to get better results without the manual tweaking.
