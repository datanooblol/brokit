## What's Coming

### Image Format Support
Testing and supporting more image formats. We want you to throw any image at it and have it just work.

### Few-Shot Tuning
DSPy-style optimization for your few-shot examples. Let the system figure out the best examples for you.

### Instruction Tuning
GEPA-inspired instruction optimization. Auto-tune your prompts to get better results without the manual tweaking.
