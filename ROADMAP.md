# Roadmap

## Done ✓

- **Foundation** - LM, Prompt, Predictor primitives
- **Vision Support** - Image class for multimodal models
- **History & Tracking** - Complete execution traces with LMHistory, PredictorHistory, ProgramHistory

## What's Coming

### Few-Shot Optimization
DSPy-style optimization for your few-shot examples. Let the system figure out the best examples for you automatically.

### Instruction Tuning
GEPA-inspired instruction optimization. Auto-tune your prompts to get better results without the manual tweaking.
