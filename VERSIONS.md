# Versions

## 0.1.0 - The Foundation Drop

First release, let's go! 🚀

**What's in the box:**
- **Prompt** - Define your input/output structure like a boss
- **LM** - Plug in any language model you want
- **Predictor** - Run your prompts and get results
- **Shot** - Few-shot examples made easy
- **Image support** - Predictor works with images (more formats coming soon)

This is the core toolkit. Everything you need to start building with LMs, nothing you don't.
